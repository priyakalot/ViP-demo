Nanayakkara, P., Bater, J., He, X., Hullman, J., Rogers, J. (2022). Visualizing Privacy-Utility Trade-Offs in Differentially Private Data Releases. _PoPETS_.

This is a demo version of **Vi**sualizing **P**rivacy (ViP), an interactive visualization interface for differential privacy (DP). We present the design and evaluation of the interface in our paper. A user can adjust the amount of privacy budget allocated to each query to see impacts on accuracy and risk (through their respective visualizations)---in this way, ViP is aimed at facilitating reasoning around key DP tradeoffs to assist in setting/splitting privacy budgets.
The live demo can be found [here](https://priyakalot.github.io/ViP-demo/).
